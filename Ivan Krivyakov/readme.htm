<P>
Enum Winsta GUI displays list of window stations and desktops on your
Windows NT computer and allows to change their properties.
<P>

<H1>1. Features</H1>

With Enum Winsta GUI you can:
<UL>
    <LI>Edit security settings of window station/desktop objects.</LI>
    <LI>Create new window stations and desktops.</LI>
    <LI>Switch to desktops of default window station <CODE>WinSta0</CODE>.</LI>
    <LI>Start <CODE>cmd.exe</CODE> on any desktop.</LI>
    <LI>Take ownership over window station and desktop objects.</LI>
</UL>
Right-click on window station or desktop name opens context menu that
contains list of possible actions. 

<H1>2. Limitations</H1>

<H2>2.1. Windows 95/98 Are Not Supported</H2>
Enum Winsta GUI will not run on Windows 95/98.<BR>
There is no point running Enum Winsta GUI on Windows 95/98 anyway,
because Windows 95/98 do not support window stations and desktops.
Enum Winsta GUI runs on Windows NT 4.0 SP4 or higher, and on Windows 2000.
On Windows NT 4.0 new security editors (<CODE>AclUI.DLL</CODE>) is required.

<H2>2.2. Inaccessible Window Stations</H2>
Enum Winsta GUI displays only those window stations for which your user accountt
has <CODE>WINSTA_ENUMERATE</CODE> right. Therefore, it is possible that some "invisible"
window stations exist. Windows NT does not have documented way of displaying all
window stations regardless of <CODE>WINSTA_ENUMERATE</CODE> right.
<P>
Furthermore, if you remove <CODE>WINSTA_ENUMERATE</CODE> right from a 
windows station, it becomes "invisible" to you and there is no
way to return it back to view, except for rebooting the computer.

<H2>2.3. Inaccessible Desktops</H2>
Desktop is accessible only if you have <CODE>WINSTA_ENUMDESKTOPS</CODE> right for
the parent window station. You can enable or disable this right using security
editor built into Enum Winsta GUI.

<H2>2.4. Take Ownership</H2>
In case of window stations and desktops, Windows NT does not provide
documented means for taking ownership on objects for which you don't
have any access at all. Therefore, take ownership does not always work.

<H2>2.5. Switch To Desktop</H2>
Switch to desktop feature works only for desktops of <CODE>WinSta0</CODE>
window station. This limitation is by design. In Windows NT only desktops
of <CODE>WinSta0</CODE> can be displayed on the physical screen.

<H2>2.6. Creating Window Stations and Desktops</H2>
Sometimes when you create window station or desktop, it disappears when
you exit and restart Enum Winsta GUI application. This behavior is by design.
In Windows NT object (window station, desktop, event, semaphore, etc.) 
is automatically removed when last handle to the object is closed. 
When you create window station or desktop object, Enum Winsta GUI holds 
open handle to the object until the end of the program. When Enum Winsta GUI
program exits all its handles are automatically closed. If no other program 
references window station or desktop object in question, the object will be 
automatically removed by Windows NT. To prevent this you may run
<CODE>cmd.exe</CODE> on the desktop in question. For window station you will
have to create a desktop and run <CODE>cmd.exe</CODE> on that desktop.

<H2>2.7. Access to <CODE>Winlogon</CODE> Desktop</H2>
It seems that in order to open <CODE>Winlogon</CODE> desktop, one needs
<CODE>DESKTOP_READOBJECTS</CODE> and <CODE>DESKTOP_WRITEOBJECTS</CODE>
rights, even if they are not specified in <CODE>AccessMask</CODE> parameter 
of <CODE>OpenDesktop()</CODE>. This is unique for <CODE>Winlogon</CODE> -
all other desktops behave properly with <CODE>OpenDesktop</CODE>.
Since even administrators normally don't have those rights on <CODE>Winlogon</CODE>
desktop, it can normally be opened only by <CODE>LocalSystem</CODE> account.

<H1>3. Running Enum Winsta GUI Under LocalSystem Account</H1>
You will have much less restricted access to Enum Winsta GUI if you run it
under LocalSystem account. To do so, use Keith Brown's <CODE>CmdAsUser</CODE> 
tool from <A HREF="http://www.develop.com/kbrown/security/samples.htm">
www.develop.com/kbrown/security/samples.htm</A>, or <CODE>su.exe</CODE>
from Windows NT Resource Kit.

<H1>4. To Do List</H1>
<OL>
<LI>If there are too many window stations and desktops and the tree view
must be scrolled, tree view jumps to the end of list every time it is refreshed.
This may be very frustrating. Although, on a typical system it is unlikely that
there are so many window stations and desktops that they don't fit in the window.
</LI>
<LI>Undocumented NT API (<CODE>NtQueryDirectoryObject</CODE>???) allows to list 
all window stations, even those on which caller does not have 
<CODE>WINSTA_ENUMERATE</CODE> right. These functions are used by <CODE>WinObj</CODE> 
utility from 
<A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/winobj.shtml">www.sysinternals.com</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Find a way to take ownership on inaccessible desktops/window stations.
</LI>
